### Some rust terms that have special meaning

- Empowering everyone — All programmers regardless of ability or background are welcome to participate. Programming, and particularly systems programming, should not be restricted to a blessed few.

- Blazingly fast — Rust is a fast programming language. You’ll be able to write programs that match or exceed the performance of its peer languages, but you will have more safety guarantees.

- Fearless concurrency — Concurrent and parallel programming have always been seen as difficult. Rust frees you from whole classes of errors that have plagued its peer languages.

- No Rust 2.0 — Rust code written today will always compile with a future Rust compiler. Rust is intended to be a reliable programming language that can be depended upon for decades to come. In accordance with semantic versioning, Rust is never backward-incompatible, so it will never release a new major version.

- Zero-cost abstractions — The features you gain from Rust impose no runtime cost. When you program in Rust, safety does not sacrifice speed.
